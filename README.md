# custom_splash_screen

Simple custom splash screen

## This custom splash screen doesn't override or replace the use of a native splash screen,
## As there would still be a blank splash page before the app starts running. 

## I think it wouldn't hurt to have a native splash screen and after that a custom splash that maybe shows a different detail about the app.

## Same format can also be used when you want to display a page for a short period of time, just align your paths correctly and adjust the timer and other details.
